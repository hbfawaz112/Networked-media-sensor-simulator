# Networked Media Sensors Simulator
The purpose of this project is to study the behaviour of a networked multimedia sensors. The objective is to model this kind of network, define protocols for the communication between its elements, and implement a simulation architecture of such a network

## Run And Execution
In our case , the whole project is write in the Netbeans IDE and compiling and run their , so simply open the 4 projects in netbeans and start running one after an other.
(If we want to run the projects with cmd , you need to change how the registery is created and looked up in our code , but simply also we can).

### Order Of Execution (Projects opened in netbeans , SRC directory)
 1- Run the DataServer <br>
 2- Run the Sink<br>
 3- Run the supervisor<br>
 4- Then start run the senosr(we can run multiple sensor)<br>

#### More information for how the sumiluation is work is in the User.pdf in Docs directory

## Tech Used
 Java programming language with TCP Socket and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) over TCP.
