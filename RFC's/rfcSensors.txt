**********Introduction  [1]*************************
	
	This document containe a description or a roadmap relating to the communication protocol.
This roadmap provide a summary of the rfc Sensors [RFC Sensors] containing the objectif of this
 Protocol , the type of it's interfaces(hosts),his principle oprations , the format of the exchanged data ,ectâ€¦ .
 

************************************************************************************************************


*****************Objectif :[2]*********************** 
  
   This protocol is used in Networked multimedia sensors simulator.
  The main objectif of this prtocol is to describe and handle all exchanged data and oprations
 between  sensors and the sink (sink is a main sensor but he can't capture ,
 The sink has a specific operations diffrent from the other sensors ) in this simulation.

 A sensor is an autonomous element capable 
of acquiring information , it can capture images . audio , temperature ect... . 
 so a sensor it's capable to capture and obtain information such a media 
	(in our simulation will be a data of a weather (Temperature and humidity))
 
  
************************************************************************************************************

**************Similation (aricheticture)*******************************

		    
      
       Sink    <-- root (requests issuer and responses recipient from the network)
     /     \
    SA       SB    <-- High level sensors(capturing and routing)
   / \     /    \  
  SA1 SA2 SB1    SB2 <-- Base level sensors(just capturing)
		.
	
****************Network protocol :[3]*****************************************
	  
Because each one of the sensor and sink are separetly implemented , and each one of them have 
an IP adress and a prot associated to a  transport layer in a LAN network. (MultiNetworking) .
It can be TCP - UDP - RMI , ect...
In our case we will use RMI over TCP [RFC 793].(format data will be describted down below)

************************************************************************************************************

*******************************************************************************************************
******Principle Operation [4]*********
    
  ***********Sensors Types*************
 In our simulation we have a multliple types of sensors , devides into 3 types: 

1-A sink sensor , Roles : 
      A- The main role is to initiates the queries (the data format will be describe down bellow)
 	and receives the final resulted data. (requests issuer and responses recipient from the network)
      B- When a sensor succefully has his own information after the RFC Supervision , he send them to sink 
	to save this sensor .
2- The base level sensors : Their main job is simply  send to the data server using the data transmition protocol
[RFC data] their descriptors , and recieve the media stream based on it's descriptor (Capture Data)
3- The middle level sensors (higher tiers) : Same job of the base level.


  ************How the work is done? **********

   After getting the sensor his descriptor by using the [RFC Supervision] and  getting the result data from 
data server using [RFC Data] , he send it to the sink and the last one receive this data save them.
	
    
************************************************************************************************************


***************Format of exchanged data [5]:********************
 
0 - Because we need to use the transport layer  protocol and specific the TCP protocol , we need to specify:
 -the source ip@ and port 
 -the destination ip@ and port


	
1-Between sensor and sink:
   The seonsor after his capture the data , send the specific weather in required zone to the sink (listed above).
    The format of this data is : 
    
    Message From Sensor To Sink id:parentid:requesttype:coveragezone:Status:Rquireddata
		ex: Message From Sensor To Sink 1:0:Temperature:ZoneA:Registring...:30.0
		 		 
   all these data are in simple format (byte code) {for example simple data types}
