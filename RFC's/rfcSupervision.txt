**********Introduction  [1]*************************
	
	This document containe a description or a roadmap relating to the suppervision protocol.
This roadmap provide a summary of the rfc Supervision[RFC Suppervision] containing the objectif of this
 Protocol , the type of it's interfaces(hosts),his principle oprations , the format of the exchanged data ,ectâ€¦ .
 

************************************************************************************************************


*****************Objectif :[2]*********************** 
  
   This protocol is used in Networked multimedia sensors simulator.
   It's a host-to-host prtocol
  The main objectif of this prtocol is to describe and handle all exchanged data and oprations
 between the 2 hosts.

A host called Supervisor : Rather than having to manage, configure and 
supervise locally and independently each [application simulating a] sensor, these setup, 
configuration and supervising operations of the various sensors will be performed remotely 
by a supervisor , and he can additionally add a sensor to the simmulation.

Each sensor communicates with the same supervisor server

************************************************************************************************************


	
****************Network protocol :[3]*****************
	  
Because each one of the sensors are separetly implemented , and each one of them have 
an IP adress and a prot associated to a  transport layer (TCP [ RFC 793] or UDP [RFC 768] ) 
in a LAN network. (MultiNetworking) .
It can be TCP - UDP - RMI , ect...
In our case we will use TCP [RFC 793].(format data will be describted down below)
TCP Socket  between a sensor and the supervisor.
************************************************************************************************************

*******************************************************************************************************
Principle Operation [4]*********
    
  ************How the work is done? **********
  Main role of supervisor btween him and a sensor is help the senor to register
 
1- Registring a new sensor : Every sensor must be first be added and configurate by the supervisor by help him to take his own descriptor
		1- Id 
		2- Parentid
		3- Request type
		4- Coverage zone
		5- Stauts   

	Request type: each group sensors can capture a specific data from data server (s1 capture wind speed in zoneA ,s2 capture temperature in zoneB , ect..)
   	
2 - Update some parameteres for a specific sensors  (for example : change it's status , pause or ready ) {this happen between the supervisor and the sink}

The sink is a sensor(Main senor , the end user) , their are more operations between to do between him and the supervsor:
	The supervisor can ask the sink to send him a list of registred sensors.
	The supervisor told the sink to update the status of a specific sensor(pause or ready(resume)) 

    
************************************************************************************************************


***************Format of exchanged data [5]:*******************************************

The exchanged data between the supervisor and the sensors network : 
    this data will be transfer btween a new sensot want to register and the supervisor : 
  "Register Me" : from sensor to supervisor
  "enter the sensor id:": from supervisor to sensor
  "ok1"	: from sensor to supervisor
  "enter the sensor parent id" :from supervisor to sensor
  "ok2" : from sensor to supervisor
  "enter the request type " :from supervisor to sensor
  "ok3":from sensor to supervisor
  "enter the coverage zone" :from supervisor to sensor

For the format of exchange data between the supervisor and the sink are :
	when the supervisor want to update : 

			sensorid:pause (ex : 2:pause) => that mean the supervisor ask to update the status of the 
		sensor id=2 to pause
 
			sensorid:Registred And Ready (ex : Registred And Ready=> that mean the supervisor ask to update the status of the 
		sensor id=2 to Registred And Ready
